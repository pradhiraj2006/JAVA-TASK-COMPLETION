TASK 1: File Handling Utility:

(Java File Handling)

This project demonstrates how Java can be used to work with text files.
It shows how to read data from a file, write new data into a file, and modify existing content.

The application uses Java’s file-handling classes to:

Open and read text files

Write user input to files

Update or append content safely

This task helps in understanding how Java manages files and is useful for applications like log systems, configuration files, and data storage.



TASK 2: REST API, HTTP, JSON Parsing:

(Java Application to Consume a Public REST API)

This project demonstrates how a Java application communicates with a public REST API over the internet.

The program:

Sends an HTTP request to a REST API

Receives data in JSON format

Parses the JSON response

Displays useful information to the user

This task helps in understanding how modern applications fetch real-time data such as weather updates, user details, or stock prices from external services.



TASK 3: Client–Server Chat Application using Java Sockets & Multithreading:

(Networking & Multithreading)

This project implements a simple chat application using Java sockets.

It consists of:

A server that listens for client connections

Multiple clients that can connect to the server

Multithreading to handle multiple clients at the same time

This task demonstrates how data is exchanged between systems over a network and how Java handles multiple users simultaneously in real-time applications.



TASK 4: Recommendation System using Java & Apache Mahout:

(Collaborative Filtering)

This project demonstrates a recommendation system that suggests items based on user preferences.

Using Apache Mahout, the system:

Analyzes user behavior and ratings

Identifies similar users

Recommends items based on shared interests (Collaborative Filtering)

This task shows how recommendation engines used by platforms like Netflix and Amazon work to suggest products or content to users.
